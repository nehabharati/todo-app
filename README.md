## Features of the app

- User can add any number of items into the todo list
- User can tick off the completed items and those items will be sent to the "Completed" column
- User can sort the Todo items and completed items using the "Sort" button
- User is allowed to enter only 20 characters for every new todo item
- User can move the items around based on priority in both the lists using arrow marks

## Extra functionality

- User can delete any item from todo list and completed list
- For the character limit, instead of form validation, went with a simpler approach where user can't be allowed to exceed the limit
  - Reason for this is that user doesn't need to keep track of the character limit and is instead prompted beforehand
